Unresolved Issues:  

Notes: Everything went smooth as far as working together and our program came together pretty quickly and relatively easily.
I think I lucked out with great groupmates.

Purpose:  

Learn to use use arrays.  
Practice your previously learned skills in a group situation.  


Instructions:  

Name your project "SSD".  

This is a project you will work on with a group of 3 (or 4) students.  

If you have 4 students, you will need to arrange yourselves into a square. The person on your left and right are your immediate partners. Groups of 3 will already have a left and right partner.  

Your assignment is to learn how to create code for others to use and how to use other people's code in your own project. Working with others is often a challenge especially when you haven't worked with them previously. If you know one of your partners from outside the class, you'll need to choose a different partner.  

You will create a function that calculates the "Sample Standard Deviation" on an array of N ints where the value of N is 25 - strlen(your middle name). If you don't have a middle name, strlen will return 0.  

You will need to create an array of random int values you will place into an array in code. DO NOT enter the values through std::cin.  

You will give your function to your right partner and your data to your left partner.  

Likewise, you will receive data from your right partner and a function from your left partner.  

Your function should be placed in .cpp file by itself and include a .h (header) file with the function declaration.  

You should now have 2 sets of data and 2 functions.  

Run all 4 combinations in one program and test that the Sample Standard Deviation functions both produce the same results for the same data set. This means you will have 2 tests, one for each set of data.  

You should compare your results with your partners. They should produce the same results. If not, work out why.  

On your assignment be sure to indicate your left and right partner in this README.md file. This is important and failing to do so will not allow me to check your work possibly resulting in a zero grade.  

Proper submission is extremely important, so be sure to look over the guidelines. You should confirm your submission is correct with the instructor if you have any doubts.
